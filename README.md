DataSplitter is a VBA program designed to organize and split data from one worksheet into another based on a specified criteria. 
This program sorts data from a source worksheet and moves it to a destination worksheet named "Split Data." If the "Split Data" worksheet does not exist, the program creates it.
The data is split based on the first two characters of each cell's value in a specified column, creating separate sections for each unique prefix. 
This tool is useful for efficiently organizing and categorizing large datasets in Excel.
